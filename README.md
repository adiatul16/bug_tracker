# Bug Tracker For Redmi Note 7 ( lavender)

Since the telegram and xda is full of issue spams , I have decided to create this bug tracker  so that each issue is identified properly and fixed . You can also track the issues yourself through this.

##### Follow the below format and create a issue  going to the issues page on this repo :

1 .Put the name of the problem as the **Title** of the issue <br />
2. Then in the write window : <br />

* Rom Name : 
* Build Date :
* Rooted or Unrooted :
* Custom Kernel or Stock Kernel : 
* Steps to reproduce the problem :
* Any magisk modules ? : 
* Logcat : 

##### Note : All the informations are necessary for faster fix of any issues . ( Logcats are  most essential )  you can either paste the logs in hastebin.com or del.dog or take via Matlogs and link it here or use the md editor to paste it in a way so that its understandable. if there is already an issue thats already been posted by someone that you wanna post , you can repost it. 

You can also link to screenshot of the problem if it is possible though its not mandatory.
